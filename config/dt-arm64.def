# This platform is a generic ARM64 platform that includes support for all
# Device Tree-based platforms.
#
# There are also configurations for individual platforms which can be used to
# build a smaller loader binary when only a single platform is required.
#
# Using an individual platform also allows better debugging of early
# initialization, as it allows using a hardcoded platform-specific UART
# location rather than having to probe the DT to get it.
