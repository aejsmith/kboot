This is a build of OVMF revision 14854, taken from the openSUSE binary package:

  https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/Virtualization/OVMF?repository=openSUSE_13.1

The official prebuilt versions of OVMF are outdated and do not work on newer
versions of QEMU, hence why this build was used instead.

The PXE ROMs in this directory are for use by the EFI PXE test target. These
ROMs are built with the following patches applied:

  http://lists.ipxe.org/pipermail/ipxe-devel/2015-March/004008.html
  http://lists.ipxe.org/pipermail/ipxe-devel/2015-March/004009.html

The latter prevents iPXE from registering its own load file protocol on
network device handles, as doing so causes EDK to fail to register the PXE
base code protocol (it tries to do so at the same time as installing its own
load file protocol). These ROMs can be removed once the builds in upstream
QEMU include these patches.

The firmware stores non-volatile settings in the ROM image itself (QEMU will
write to the ROM), therefore the EFI test scripts take a copy of the image
to prevent modifying the in-tree copy. We have multiple copies of the ROM
image, one pre-configured to boot from HD and one to boot network, for the
HD and PXE test scripts.
